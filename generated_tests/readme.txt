This directory contains randomly generated test files for use with QED. Each file is a
series of function calls and not much else. They were created with testingcreator.py,
which can be used to generate more of these files.

There were a lot more beforehand, but since it's so easy to generate new testfiles, I
decided to just leave a few examples of different sizes here.

The goal of these files was to do larger-scale testing to find uncommon bugs and other
edge cases.
